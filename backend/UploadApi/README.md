# Upload API

Your task is to create a restful JSON backend API with Ruby that allows users to upload files and manage them.

**MUST** Features is the minimum needed to consider the task completed.

**CAN** Features is extras that are on top of the minimum and are extra point during evaluation.

## MUST Features

* A user must be able to login (via email and password)
* A user can upload a file to their account. The **name** and **binary** of the file must be stored
* Uploads can be deleted
* Uploads can be downloaded

## CAN Features

* User registration
* User management:
  * change their own passwords
  * delete their own account
* Generate image previews for uploads (e.g. on PDF or image uploads)

## NON-FUNCTIONAL requirements

* Use off-the-shelf components and frameworks (misc. Rails Components, ActiveStorage, Devise, Rspec, â€¦)
* Create Unit and Integration tests
* Add at least some README style docs for installing, setup and running the app

## Keep in mind:

* Every solution is considered - even incomplete
* Solutions are ideally hosted on your public github (or whatever code hosting platform you prefer) account
